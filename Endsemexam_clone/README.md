# Endsemexam_clone (placeholder)

This folder is intentionally added to the repository so that a "clone" folder is visible on GitHub.

It contains a short note and can be used to hold any verification or snapshot files you want visible inside the repo. The actual local clone created earlier lives at `C:\Users\reddy\Desktop\Labendsem\Endsemexam_clone` on your machine.

To remove this placeholder later, delete this folder and push the change.
